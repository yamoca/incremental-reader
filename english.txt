Since you are a paragon of piety, since you loved your excellent brother and he was very devoted to you with equal devotion and as you loe his daughter as your own, and since you show not only the love of an aunt but also of a lost father, I do not doubt there will be greatest joy for you when you know that she is turning out to be worth of her father, worthy of you, and worth of her grandfather.
