    "latin": "Primus ibi ante omnis magna comitante caterva Laocoon ardens summa decurrit ab arce, et procul 'o miseri, quae tanta insania, cives? creditis avectos hostis? aut ulla putatis dona carere dolis Danaum? sic notus Ulixes? aut hoc inclusi ligno occultantur Achivi, aut haec in nostros fabricata est machina muros, inspectura domos venturaque desuper urbi, aut aliquis latet error; equo ne credite, Teucri. quidquid id est, timeo Danaos et dona ferentis.'",
    "english": "Then first before everyone and with a great crowd accompanying him, Laocoon, blazing, ran down from the very top of the citadel and said from a distance, 'Oh unfortunate citizens, what such great madness is this? Do you beleive that the enemy have sailed away? or do you think that any gifts from the greeks are free from tricks? Is Ulysses not thus known? Shut up in this wood, greeks are hidden, or this was built as a contraption against our walls, To spy on our homes and to swoop down on the city from above, or some deception or another lies hidden inside; don't trust the horse, Trojans. Whatever it is, I fear the greeks, even when bringing gifts.'"
