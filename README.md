# An incremental reader/translation app inspired by supermemo and my experience learning latin literature

## How it works:
- translate a passage section by section
- the sections that you translate start of small, e.g clause by clause
- as you gain reps and increase your accuracy, sections will get chunked together, allowing for longer translations of recognisable sections

## Why I created it:

Previously, I used anki to learn latin literature by manually creating flashcards sentence by sentence. 

This was good for spaced repitition and simplicity but this specific usecase had several key problems:
- Manually creating flashcards took time, and deciding how to break up the passage was difficult
- Created strong but narrow pattern recognition: when presented with a flashcard, translation was easy, but when faced with a chunk of text in an exam that wasn't split into my recognisable chunks, I had to scan through and seperate it out into the sections that my brain knew.
- I had a lack of "timeline": due to the spaced repitition algorithm, anki of course didn't show the flashcards in order, meaning my knowledge of the overall plot and where each section of text fit in was poor.
